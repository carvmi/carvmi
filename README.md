Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Milena, passionate about communication (verbal, non-verbal, written, and visual), goal-oriented and flexible. I entered the technology area with the goal of pursuing an international career as a developer.

In 2020, I enrolled for the Design course at UFPE in Caruaru, however, there was a delay for classes to start because of the pandemic. In the meantime, I studied design in a self-taught way and also took a writing course for the diplomacy contest that helped expand my vocabulary and grammatical knowledge of the English language. 

When I started classes at UFPE, I took a course on design thinking for innovation in government and understood how the public sector depends on private companies for innovation and digital transformation. At that point, I began to have a greater interest in technology than in design or diplomacy.
