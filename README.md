Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Milena, passionate about communication (verbal, non-verbal, written, and visual), goal-oriented and flexible. I entered the technology area with the goal of pursuing an international career as a developer.

In 2020, I enrolled in the Design course at UFPE in Caruaru, however, there was a delay because of the pandemic. In the meantime, I studied design in a self-taught way. Furthermore, I took a writing course for the diplomacy contest that helped expand my vocabulary and grammatical knowledge of the English language. 

When I started classes at UFPE, I understood how the public sector depends on private companies for innovation and digital transformation when studying design thinking for innovation in government. At that point, my interest in technology became greater than in design or diplomacy.
